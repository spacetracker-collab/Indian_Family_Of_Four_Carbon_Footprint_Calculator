**Home Energy Controller**

The below user interface was developed for a research project on home energy control. This is included just a reference. This was published in a conference paper.

**Carbon Footprint**

We all know that the world is being subject to climate change. As a result, the world is warming. This leads to melting of the polar icecaps among many other things. Due to the melting ice caps, the sea levels rise and coastal regions are flooded. Further, there is more occurence of "Extreme Weather Events" like cyclones, tornadoes and tsunami. The major contributor to global warming are transportation, industry, animal farming, agriculture and buildings; in no particular order. All countries have pledged to reduce their Carbon Footprint so that we do not destroy our Earthern habitat. Of course, there are technologies ranging from Carbon Sequestration to Colonizing Mars that can solve the problem. But as everybody knows : "A penny saved is a penny earned". Hence we should be cautious of the Carbon  Footprint we leave in this world at a consumer level. 

**Genesis of this sheet and Findings**

We lived in a family of four. Mother, Daughter, Father and Grandfather. We had a Great-Grandmother but she had less to neglible usage of anything. Since, we are well off as compared to the average Indian, our family footprint was 5 times the average Indian Footprint of 1.4 Tons per person per year.

**Missing Items**

This sheet was created in 2011. The  new items to be added to this sheet are

* 2 Canines
* 2 Felines
* Smartphones per person
* Smart Speakers
* Fiber Optics and Wireless Local Area Network
* 4G and 5G

We are also growing some Plants, that may offset some of the Carbon FootPrints

**Miscellaneous Information**


In 2011, I also discovered that 1 Google Employee can save the Carbon Footprint of 22 Americans. Further, Google mostly runs on Hydro-Electric Power. There was a search engine called Blackle, but todays smartphones have "Invert Colors" as a built in feature.
